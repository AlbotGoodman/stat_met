# Statistical methods

This is a repo for a university course in statistical methods.  

The repo will both contain lectures, exercises and a lab assignment. The endgame of this repo is the actual lab where the assignment is to do a statistical analysis with the help of linear regression.  

## The lab  

My personal objective of this lab is to go a bit beyond statistical analysis and use my regression model for prediction. I will split the dataset into sets for training, validation and testing and deploy aforementioned statistics to compare my results and judge wether the model is any good or not.
